## Description

#### Problem

- Create a Mini Store where users can see pagination on items, sort the items, add the item to their cart and remove from cart.

#### API :-

✅ URL :- `https://dbioz2ek0e.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mockapi/get-products`
✅ Query Params :-
`limit=(Number of items per page)`
`page=(Page number)`

#### Description

- On page loads make a fetch request to the above given API.
- the default page is `1` and the limit is `6` per page
- On index.html(Home Page), the user will be able to see a list of items with `add to cart` option.
- Maximum `6` items will be shown per page (**Implement Pagination**).
- There will be two buttons previous and next, to navigate between pages.
- The `previous` button should be disabled on page 1 and the next button should be disabled on the last page.
- on clicking the previous button decrement the current page by 1 and make a fetch request with the new page number and get the details.
- on clicking the next button increment the current page by 1 and make a fetch request and get the details.
- Show the current page number on top between the two buttons(**Only Page number no extra text**)

- Give two buttons to sort the items
- On sorting, only the items present on the current page should be sorted.

- Navbar will have a link to the home page and cart page.
- It will also show the number of items added to the cart.
- the cart count is 0 by default.
- Both the home page and cart page will have the same navbar with the same functionality(**Use Import Export**)
- Store the items added to the cart in the `local-storage` with the key as **cart**.
- The cart page will show the items added to the cart, with an option to remove them.
- On removing any item the item should be removed from local storage as well and the total count of cart items in the navbar should also update.

#### Things to follow :-

1.  Navbar
    (**Create a function `navbar` which will return navbar elements and export from navbar.js**)

- The cart link should have `id = "cart"`
- The home or index page link should have `id = home`
- Cart count should have a div with `id = cart_count`

2.  Home page (index.html)

- The previous button should have an `id ="previous"`
- Next button should have an `id ="next"`
- The page number tag have an `id ="page_number"`
- Sort Low to High button have `id ="sort-lth"`
- Sort High to Low button have `id ="sort-htl"`

- All the items will be appended inside a parent `div` with an `id ="main_items"`
- Each item should be displayed as cards and the should have a `class ="item"`
- The price tag in every card should have `class ="price"`
- Add to cart button should have a `class = "add_to_cart"`

3.  Cart Page (cart.html)

- use the styles folder to style for index and cart pages

## Note:-

#### Strictly follow the template. Cross-check HTML Id's and classes.

#### Focus more on the functionality of your app. Avoid spending more time styling. You can do that once you finish the end-to-end flow of app. All the best!

**Note:- Do not use any other names for the methods other than those mentioned.**
